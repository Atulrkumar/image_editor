# AI Image Text Editor ✨# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models



A powerful web-based image editor that uses AI to extract text from images, allows live editing with drag-and-drop positioning, and generates creative variations using free AI services. **100% FREE** - no API keys required!Welcome to the **Image Generation with Pre-trained Models** repository! This project demonstrates how to utilize pre-trained generative models like DALL-E-mini and Stable Diffusion to create images from text prompts. These models enable the generation of high-quality images by leveraging powerful deep learning architectures trained on extensive datasets.

### InstallationThis repository provides a framework for generating images from text prompts using pre-trained generative models. It covers how to use models like DALL-E-mini and Stable Diffusion to create visuals directly from text descriptions. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a developer, or a designer, this project offers a hands-on approach to exploring the capabilities of generative AI.



1. **Clone the repository**## Getting Started

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Atulrkumar/Image_Editor.git### Prerequisites

cd Image_Editor

```Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:



2. **Install dependencies**- Python 3.7+

```bash- Git

pip install -r requirements_free.txt- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

```

### Installation

3. **Run the app**

```bash1. **Clone the Repository**

python app_free.py

```   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-generation-pretrained-models.git

4. **Open in browser**   cd image-generation-pretrained-models

```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🌐 Deploy to Vercel

This project is ready to deploy to Vercel using Python serverless functions!

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click **"Add New Project"**
   - Import your GitHub repository: `Atulrkumar/Image_Editor`
   - Vercel will auto-detect `vercel.json` and use Python runtime
   - Click **"Deploy"**
   - Your app will be live in ~2 minutes!

### Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### ⚠️ Important Serverless Limitations

Since Vercel uses serverless functions, some features are simplified:

- **No OCR**: EasyOCR and heavy ML packages don't work in serverless (they're too large)
- **Manual Text Entry**: Users add text manually instead of auto-detection
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Uploaded files don't persist (handled in memory)
- **10-second Timeout**: Long AI operations may timeout (use Pollinations.ai for speed)

**What Works:**
✅ Image upload and preview  
✅ Manual text editing with drag-and-drop  
✅ AI background variations (Pollinations.ai)  
✅ Meme caption suggestions  
✅ Download edited images  

**What Doesn't Work in Serverless:**
❌ Automatic OCR text extraction  
❌ Persistent file storage  
❌ Heavy image processing (OpenCV)  

### Alternative: Deploy with Full OCR on Other Platforms

For full OCR functionality, deploy to platforms that support long-running containers:
- **Render.com** (Docker support, free tier)
- **Railway.app** (Docker support, $5/month)
- **Fly.io** (Docker support, generous free tier)
- **Google Cloud Run** (Container support, pay-as-you-go)

Use the `Dockerfile` in this repo for container-based deployments.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload Image** - User uploads an image (drag & drop or file picker)
2. **OCR Extraction** - EasyOCR detects and extracts text with positions
3. **Text Removal** - OpenCV inpainting removes original text from background
4. **Interactive Canvas** - HTML5 Canvas displays clean image with editable text overlays
5. **Drag & Drop** - User repositions, edits, and styles text elements
6. **AI Generation** - Pollinations.ai generates 3 variations with new backgrounds (optional)
7. **Download** - User downloads edited image or AI variations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.11)
- **OCR**: EasyOCR + OpenCV
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **AI Generation**: Pollinations.ai (FREE, no API key)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas
- **Deployment**: Docker + Vercel

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
# Optional: Hugging Face API key for alternative AI models
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
```

The app works perfectly **without** any API keys using Pollinations.ai!

## 🎨 Usage Guide

1. **Upload an Image**
   - Drag & drop or click "Choose Image"
   - Supports JPG, PNG, WEBP

2. **Edit Text**
   - Click and drag text on the canvas to reposition
   - Edit text content in the sidebar
   - Change colors with the color picker
   - Add new text elements with "➕ Add New Text"

3. **Generate Variations**
   - Leave prompt empty → Apply effects only
   - Add prompt (e.g., "ocean sunset") → AI changes background
   - Get 3 variations instantly

4. **Generate Memes**
   - Click "🎭 Get Meme Ideas"
   - AI suggests 5 funny captions
   - Click any caption to apply it

5. **Download**
   - Click "💾 Download Image" for current canvas
   - Or download any variation individually
